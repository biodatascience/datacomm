This BCB module will be taught by [Michael Love](https://mikelove.github.io) (he/him).

**Contact:** love [at] unc.edu, please include **"724"** in the subject line.

This module is designed to prepare students to be effective
communicators of the results of analyses of biological and biomedical
data. Students will learn methods for data assessment and exploratory
data analysis (EDA), and how to visualize, write, and talk about data
in contexts such as emails, reports, lab meetings, publications, and
conference presentations. No technical or statistical background
required for enrollment. 

**Accessibility**

I seek to make the module content accessible to all students.  Please
reach out to me via [ARS Hub](http://arshub.unc.edu/) if you have any
accommodations needed for accessibility. This will send me an email. I
will provide digital copies of all required reading. Aside from the
first class, which will be a pre-recorded lecture, the rest of the
classes will be in-person at 2004 Marsico, and typically involve
discussion, breakout groups, and exchanging of student-created
content (e.g. reading and critiquing content from other students).
