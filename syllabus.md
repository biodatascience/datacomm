### Course description

This course is designed to prepare students to be effective
communicators of the results of analyses of biological and biomedical
data. Students will learn methods for data assessment and exploratory
data analysis (EDA), and how to visualize, write, and talk about data
in contexts such as emails, reports, lab meetings, publications, and
conference presentations. No technical or statistical background
required for enrollment. 

### Course requirements

To obtain full credit, students must attend 7/9 of classes,
complete all reading and homework assignments, and achieve a passing
grade overall. If any students believe they may have to miss more that
two of the lectures, they must discuss this with the lead instructor
in advance.

### Grading rubric

* Reading quizzes: 40%
* Communication products and critique: 60%

### Syllabus

This course focuses on topics in visualizing, writing, and speaking
about biological and biomedical data. Each class will involve short
reading assignments about data communication, with in-class
discussions and quizzes on that material. Students will explore
datasets provided during the course, and typical homework assignments
will be to present a particular data analysis result in a written
report. Basic R or python code can be used in these
assignments. Students will be assessed on communication
quality, whereas other BCB courses such as BCB 720 (which can be taken
concurrently) focus on statistical inference. Students will evaluate
the written products (homework) of other students, to develop their
critical mindset for technical diagrams and writing.

### Generative AI in BCB 724

Allowed:

* It is allowed to use Generative AI to correct spelling or grammar in 
  your assignments in BCB 724.

Not allowed:

* It is not allowed to use Generative AI to write entire paragraphs
  of text and submit as one's own work as a writing assigment.
* It is not allowed to use Generative AI to critique others' work. 

Instructors:

* Instructors (myself and TAs) will not use Generative AI to grade 
  your assignments.

The point of the class is to help students develop communication skills, to draw
upon in a variety of contexts, including collaborative meetings and
conferences. In addition, large sections of text from Generative AI is currently
somewhat obvious to detect in scientific writing, and including large sections
of text that you did not write is likely to go against your own objectives in
communication.

Generative AI can be useful in drafting boilerplate communications,
or in brainstorming ideas, but I recommend to read the 
[Guidance from the UNC Committee](https://provost.unc.edu/generative-ai-usage-guidance-for-the-research-community/)
on usage in research, in particular risks regarding bias,
confidentiality, and intellectual property/plagiarism.

**Note:** It is never allowed to paste HIPAA- or FERPA-protected data 
into public Generative AI tools.
