### Course description

This course is designed to prepare students to be effective
communicators of the results of analyses of biological and biomedical
data. Students will learn methods for data assessment and exploratory
data analysis (EDA), and how to visualize, write, and talk about data
in contexts such as emails, reports, lab meetings, publications, and
conference presentations. No technical or statistical background
required for enrollment. 

### Course requirements

To obtain full credit, students must attend 7/9 of the lectures,
complete all reading and homework assignments, and achieve a passing
grade overall. If any students believe they may have to miss more that
2 of the lectures, they must discuss this with the lead instructor
in advance.

### Grading rubric

* Reading quizzes: 15%
* Homework assignments: 60%
* Cross-evaluations: 10%
* Poster session 15%

### Syllabus

This course focuses on topics in visualizing, writing, and speaking
about biological and biomedical data. Each class will involve short
reading assignments about data communication, with in-class
discussions and quizzes on that material. Students will explore
datasets provided during the course, and typical homework assignments
will be to present a particular data analysis result in a written
report. Basic R or python code can be used in these
assignments. Students will be assessed on presentation quality,
whereas other BCB courses such as BCB 720 (which can be taken
concurrently) focus on statistical inference. Students will evaluate
the written products (homework) of other students, to develop their
critical mindset for technical diagrams and writing. Students will
practice verbal communication by presenting a (digital) poster, where
they will create and present slides showing the results of a data
analysis.

### Generative AI

It is allowed to use Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT) to correct
spelling/grammar in your assignments in BCB 724.

I do not want students to use Generative AI to write entire paragraphs
of text and submit as one's own work, nor to critique others'
work. This type of usage is therefore not allowed in BCB 724. The
reason for this is to help students develop inherent communication
skills, which you can draw on in a variety of contexts, including
collaborative meetings and conferences. I will not use Generative AI
to grade your assignments, and I would ask you and your peers to do
the same.

Generative AI can be useful in drafting boilerplate communications,
or in brainstorming topic outlines, but I recommend to read the 
[Guidance from the UNC Committee](https://provost.unc.edu/generative-ai-usage-guidance-for-the-research-community/)
on usage in research, in particular risks regarding bias,
confidentiality, and intellectual property/plagiarism.
It is never allowed to paste HIPAA- or FERPA-protected data into
public Generative AI tools.

I would also recommend against using Generative AI for writing code
for the few coding assignments. For someone who is still learning
programming, this strategy may save you time in the short term, but
tends to produce a shallower form of understanding, and limit your
skills in the long term.

some optional books under [resources](resources), which we will read
sections of during class.
